    <h1>What is League of Legends?</h1>
    <p>
        League of Legends is a fast paced competitive online game that people play world wide. Reason why people love this MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) so much is due to it having RTS and RPG elements to the game.
        League adds new champions to their roster very often which keeps the game very interesting and ever changing. In this game you go head to head 5v5 and see who can destroy the enemies nexus first.
